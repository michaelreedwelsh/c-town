			<h3>Local Shops and Delicious Food</h3>
			<p>
				Chestertown is home to many small shops, bars, and cafes. When I say "many" I actually mean very few. Although there aren't very many, they all have tons of personality and high quality offerings. You can find some great coffee roasted locally (Annapolis) and a good selection of Maryland beers. Pastries at the Evergrain Bread Company are not to be missed.
